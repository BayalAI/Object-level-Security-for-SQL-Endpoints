## Estimation

### Stories
Estimation for stories is done based on story points.
The Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, **8**, 13, ...)  is used for this.
As a guide, a story with 8 story points is just about realizable in a sprint.
Stories greater than 8 do not fit into one sprint and should therefore be further broken down.
### Tasks
Tasks are planned by the story owners in the team after sprint planning and estimated in hours
