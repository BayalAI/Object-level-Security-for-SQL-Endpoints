## Introduction
The Definition of Done (DoD) is a central concept in agile project management, especially in methods like Scrum. It describes a clear set of criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered "done." These criteria are specific and measurable, serving to ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what "done" means.

##  DoD for a PBI

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are fulfilled
- [ ] PBI can be demonstrated
 
**If applicable:**
- [ ] Code has been tested by developer (through automated tests - or when not possible manually)
- [ ] Code has been peer-reviewed
- [ ] Link to Pull request has been added to the work item
- [ ] Code is merged to main branch
- [ ] Code is deployed to INT environment
- [ ] Documentation is updated in Wiki
- [ ] Link to the documentation has been added to the work item

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, one must understand what ‘Done’ means. Although this may vary significantly for every Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be completed and to ensure transparency. This is the definition of ‘Done’ for the Scrum Team and it is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment
 
In short, DoD is a shared understanding within the Scrum Team on what it takes to make your Product Increment releasable.
