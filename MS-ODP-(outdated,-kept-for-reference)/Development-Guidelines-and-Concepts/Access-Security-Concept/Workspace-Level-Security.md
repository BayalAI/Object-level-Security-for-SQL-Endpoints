After you create a workspace in Microsoft Fabric, or if you have an admin or member role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. Giving Workspace level access will allow members to come into that particular workspace and view all items in it. Let's go over the steps to achieve that


Once you come inside the workspace you see the Manage access option. Click on that.

Now there are four main roles when it comes to access on a workspace level, these include

- Admin
- Contributor
- Member
- Viewer
